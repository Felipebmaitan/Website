# Personal Website

This is the repository of my website, this is under MIT License, so fell free to use anything from here, or contribute anything, if you want to (actually, if you manage to use any of this suspicious code). The code is currently mostly unfinished though, and I wouldn't trust it very much.

## TODO:

- Make the website responsive and usable on mobile devices (maybe think about using Hugo or some other static website creator);
- Create About Me, Contact and Blog pages;
